<h1><u>Tollywood Film Industry</u></h1>
<p>Telugu cinema, also known as Tollywood, is the segment of Indian cinema dedicated to the production of motion pictures in the Telugu language, widely spoken in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Telugu cinema is based in Film Nagar, Hyderabad. As of 2021, Telugu cinema is the largest film industry in India in terms of box-office.[6][7] Telugu films sold 23.3 crore (233 million) tickets in 2022, the highest among various film industries in India.[4][5]

Technical crafts of Telugu cinema, especially visual effects and cinematography, are considered as one of the most advanced in Indian cinema.[8] The industry has produced some of India's most expensive and highest-grossing films of all time. Telugu production Baahubali 2 (2017) is currently the highest-grossing film of all time in India. The Telugu film industry is home to Ramoji Film City, certified by the Guinness World Records as the largest film studio complex in the world measuring over 1,666 acres (674 ha).[9][10]</p>

<p>Since 1909, filmmaker Raghupathi Venkaiah Naidu was involved in producing short films and exhibiting them in different regions of Asia. He established the first Indian-owned cinema halls in South India.[11] In 1921, he produced the silent film, Bhishma Pratigna, generally considered to be the first Telugu feature film.[18] As the first Telugu film exhibitor and producer, Naidu is regarded as the 'Father of Telugu cinema'.[19] The first Telugu film with audible dialogue, Bhakta Prahlada (1932) was directed by H. M. Reddy. In 1933, Sati Savitri directed by C. Pullayya received an honorary diploma at the 2nd Venice Film Festival.[20] Since its inception, Telugu cinema was known as the pre-eminent centre of Hindu mythological films in India.[21] From the late 1930s, films focused on contemporary living and social issues, like Raithu Bidda (1939), were produced and gradually gained prominence.</p>
